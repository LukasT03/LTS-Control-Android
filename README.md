# ⚙️📱 LTS Control for Android

LTS Control for Android is the companion app for the [LTS Respooler](https://github.com/LukasT03/LTS-Respooler). The app allows you to connect via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), monitor spool progress, and adjust key settings such as speed, transfer amount, and motor strength.

It’s still in early development but will be built primarily with Jetpack Compose to be as platform-native as possible. It's my first Android app so the code might be a bit messy!
